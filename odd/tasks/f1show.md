# F1Show: complete distributed commentary system

## Outcome and current authorization

Build a replay-testable, real-time Formula 1 commentary system with five logical
roles: deterministic collector, tactical analyst and historian, plus two Gemini
commentator personas. Run four application services and Redis with Docker Compose.

**This session authorizes repository bootstrap, source-document preservation,
updated documentation and this ODD plan only. Application implementation, live
API/model calls, paid subscriptions, deployment and automated publication are not
authorized by creating the backlog.** The user explicitly authorized preparation
and closure commits plus the initial push to `main` after verification. This does
not authorize application implementation, PR creation or later deliveries.

## Baseline and decisions

- Workspace: `F1Show`; local Git repository, `main` created at the bootstrap commit.
- Preparation branch: `feat/f1show-bootstrap`; public GitHub repository:
  `sdsoporte/F1Show`, created with the existing SSH/gh configuration.
- Repository-local Git identity (user-selected; no global identity exists on this
  machine): `sdsoporte <211432262+sdsoporte@users.noreply.github.com>`.
- The unrelated `/home/s/.git` is not this project's repository. Never stage it.
- User chose the full documented architecture, current SDK/models, deterministic
  analyst/historian, and archiving the original Word documents now.
- Move all ten originals from `docs/` to repository-relative `origis/` with exact
  byte preservation. Nine contain extracted text; Project Notes is an empty
  document. Keep the numbered code variants: their tails contain unique material.
- Maintain new project documentation in `docs/`; originals are historical evidence,
  not executable source or authoritative current API specifications.
- Use Python async, httpx, Redis Streams and maintained `google-genai`.
  Final dependency versions and available model IDs must be verified before coding.
- Three deterministic roles make zero LLM calls. Only the commentary service uses
  Gemini. No agent framework is required for the specified initial topology.
- Historical OpenF1 data is free; real-time access requires a paid subscription.
  Replay comes first. Do not promise free live data or authorize purchases.
- Text/CLI transcript is the initial output. Audio/TTS, dashboards, social posting,
  multi-session operation and cloud deployment are separate future scope.

## ODD execution rules

1. Reconcile this file, the full Engram mirror `odd/f1show/tasks` and the visible
   todo projection before resuming. Keep stable IDs and one active task.
2. Explore each bounded unit and resolve product uncertainty before source edits.
   Use a read-only explorer when evidence exceeds a small targeted read.
3. Derive narrow edit surfaces; delegate multi-file changes to one writer. Writers
   read the task first, never change ODD bookkeeping or perform Git delivery.
4. For deterministic behavior, observe meaningful RED, minimum GREEN and refactor
   checks. Use offline fixtures and fake clocks/providers; no live calls in CI.
5. Passive documentation has no meaningful behavior RED. Check paths, links,
   original hashes, whitespace, ignored secrets and intended publication scope.
6. Preserve code, tests and relevant docs in each work-unit commit on a feature
   branch. Record the observed commit and checks; obey explicit Git authorization.
7. Native review runs only under the user's RDD switch and provider continuations,
   against a work-unit commit or bounded PR slice, never a checkbox or the entire
   project backlog. Review does not authorize push, PR creation or merge.
8. Update this file, its full mirror and todo after each actual task transition.
   Never close a task with failing required checks or missing implementation.

## Review workload and routing

- Bootstrap forecast: approximately 400–550 authored changed lines plus about
  4.7 MB of preserved binary Word sources. Check the actual count before delivery.
- The whole application will be several thousand authored lines; it is not one
  review candidate. Refine estimates before each authorized work unit.
- Delivery strategy: `auto-chain`; user-selected chain strategy:
  `feature-branch-chain`. Future units use a feature/tracker branch with bounded
  review slices. The bootstrap is one cohesive documentation/archive unit; the
  large binary sources are explicitly included, not application code.
- No PR creation or application delivery is authorized here. Choose concrete
  future slice boundaries before coding; never review the whole accumulated branch.
- About 400 authored diff lines per task is a planning heuristic, not a hard cap.
  Do not remove tests, comments or whitespace to meet it; split cohesive behavior.
- F00 route: delegated explorer (large Word corpus), delegated worker (multiple
  documentation files), bounded verification of artifacts and public-file scope.
- F01–F13 routes: scoped explorer when needed, single delegated writer, applicable
  writer checks and risk-gated independent verification. Parent owns Git/memory.

## Stable task checklist

### F00 — Bootstrap the repository and current project vision

- [x] **Done.** Isolated Git initialized, `.gitignore` created, the ten originals
  preserved in `origis/`, README/current architecture/source review written, public
  GitHub repository created with SSH origin. The authorized initial `main`
  publication of this commit closes the task.
- Checks: original count/hash equality (10/10 SHA-256 and byte counts against the
  pre-move baseline), each `.docx` readable as an OPC/ZIP package, no embedded media
  and no credential-shaped strings in any document part, Markdown links resolve,
  whitespace and final-newline hygiene, ignore matrix verified with
  `git check-ignore`, publication scope reviewed.
- No application test suite exists. Documentation/metadata checks are appropriate;
  no RED/GREEN, production readiness or complete secret audit is claimed.
- Evidence: Git root is F1Show, branch `feat/f1show-bootstrap`, gh account sdsoporte
  over SSH. Preparation commit `6ebfeff02f9d439eda1596af0bf92421de0d9025`: 15 files,
  655 authored lines plus about 4.7 MB of byte-preserved binaries.
- Independent verification found two defects, both fixed before the commit: a
  truncated SHA-256 in `origis/README.md` and a machine-local scratch path leaked
  into publishable prose. A third gap this plan did not anticipate — no Git identity
  configured on the machine, which made the required commit impossible — was closed
  with the repository-local identity recorded above.
- Known risk, not blocking: the originals embed Inter/Roboto/RobotoMono font binaries
  under their own licenses (SIL OFL / Apache), redistributed here as part of the
  unmodified documents. No application code, tests, container files or dependency
  manifests were created. Nothing else outstanding.
- The earlier admission block is resolved: it came from a session that started in
  `/home/s` before this repository had a `.git`, so the writer was refused. A session
  started from the repository root admits delegated work normally. Do not replay the
  failed jobs or reset review authority.

### F01 — Validate current external contracts and operating limits

- [ ] Verify OpenF1 historical/live access, auth, endpoint schemas, cadence and
  quotas; verify Jolpica URL, coverage and identifier mapping; current GenAI SDK
  and available model IDs. Record unknowns instead of inventing guarantees.
- Acceptance: evidence-linked dependency choices, configurable endpoint/model
  settings, explicit live access prerequisites and user-approved pilot budget.
- Gate: clarify commentary language, audience/sink and measurable latency/cost
  limits before accepting a live broadcast. No subscription/model call by default.
- Depends on F00. Commit/checks: pending.

### F02 — Establish Python foundation and shared contracts

- [ ] Create packaging/locked dependencies, typed configuration, event/enrichment/
  dialogue schemas and injectable clock, HTTP, bus and model boundaries.
- Acceptance/checks: offline tests reject malformed data, missing credentials in
  live mode, wrong session IDs, invalid timestamps and secret-bearing log output.
- Depends on F01. Commit/checks: pending.

### F03 — Implement source adapters and replay/session lifecycle

- [ ] Build httpx adapter, deterministic replay and explicit session selection;
  seed mid-session state and handle end/cancel/reset without mixing sessions.
- Acceptance/checks: fake HTTP/clock tests cover history vs live auth, timeouts,
  429/backoff, empty data, invalid responses and per-endpoint watermarks/overlap.
- Depends on F02. Commit/checks: pending.

### F04 — Implement deterministic collector and event detection

- [ ] Normalize positions, laps, sectors, flags, intervals and pit/stint data;
  deduplicate updates and preserve evidence timestamps/source fields.
- Acceptance/checks: replay proves fastest laps/sectors, position changes, flags,
  SC/VSC and pit events; no false first-lap record or inferred on-track overtake
  from a position change alone. Split event families into units when necessary.
- Depends on F03. Commit/checks: pending.

### F05 — Implement Redis Streams delivery and fan-out

- [ ] Define stream names, versioned envelopes, separate consumer groups for
  analyst/historian, acknowledgements, idempotency, recovery and retention limits.
- Acceptance/checks: local Redis tests show both enrichers receive each event,
  bounded backlog, duplicate safety and recovery after crash/pending messages.
- Depends on F02/F04. Commit/checks: pending.

### F06 — Implement deterministic tactical analysis

- [ ] Calculate contextual gap/pace/stint alerts with configurable circuit/session
  parameters. Treat tyre-life and pit-loss estimates as assumptions, not facts.
- Acceptance/checks: qualifying cutoffs follow the selected season/session rules;
  tests cover boundary values, lapped/null intervals, missing telemetry, pit
  interference and stale data. No hardcoded Monza or unqualified strategy claims.
- Depends on F04/F05. Commit/checks: pending.

### F07 — Implement evidence-grounded historical enrichment

- [ ] Query Jolpica-style archives with verified driver/circuit mappings, bounded
  caching and source/as-of attribution. Remove fabricated circuit defaults.
- Acceptance/checks: fixture-backed stats, pagination and identifier tests; unknown
  records stay absent, failures skip trivia, caches remain session/circuit-safe.
- Depends on F01/F05. Commit/checks: pending.

### F08 — Implement the current Gemini gateway and safeguards

- [ ] Use async `google-genai` with explicit verified model IDs, output bounds,
  request timeout, bounded retries/concurrency and measured usage accounting.
- Acceptance/checks: fake provider tests cover 429/5xx, timeout, missing/invalid
  responses and budget stop. Disclose accounting/enforcement limits; reported
  token usage alone does not prove a hard cost or in-flight cancellation limit.
- Depends on F01/F02. Commit/checks: pending.

### F09 — Implement the two-person commentary booth

- [ ] Implement lead/color personas, explicit turns, bounded history and structured
  transcript output using only current events and attributed enrichment.
- Acceptance/checks: fake-model tests prove ordering, evidence propagation,
  repetition suppression, stale-context exclusion and neutral outage behavior.
  Generated text quality still needs a separately authorized real-model trial.
- Depends on F06/F07/F08. Commit/checks: pending.

### F10 — Wire bounded end-to-end orchestration

- [ ] Correlate enrichment by event/session/version, apply bounded join deadlines,
  prioritize flags/incidents and expire obsolete commentary before dispatch.
- Acceptance/checks: offline replay covers missing/late enrichment, bursts,
  duplicate/out-of-order delivery and session reset; historian outages do not
  stop fresh factual calls. Queue size, timeouts and degradation are observable.
- Depends on F05/F09. Commit/checks: pending.

### F11 — Package the four services and Redis in Docker Compose

- [ ] Build collector, analyst, historian and booth images; configure internal
  Redis networking, persistence, readiness/health checks and clean shutdown.
- Acceptance/checks: Compose config/build/smoke with fixture sources and fake
  provider; non-root application containers, no embedded credentials or default
  public Redis port, readiness rather than depends_on-only startup assumptions.
- Depends on F10. Commit/checks: pending.

### F12 — Verify integrated replay, observability and CI

- [ ] Ship offline regression CI, operator instructions and end-to-end fixtures
  for race, qualifying/sprint qualifying and practice, including failures.
- Acceptance/checks: reproducible container replay, metrics for data age/end-to-end
  latency/queue/usage, sourced transcripts and graceful API/Redis/provider outage.
  Record all failed, skipped and pending checks; define measured acceptance limits.
- Depends on F11. Commit/checks: pending.

### F13 — Run one separately authorized live pilot

- [ ] Confirm subscription/credentials, session availability and a human-approved
  request/token/cost/time ceiling; verify known enforcement limitations first.
- Acceptance/checks: one bounded real session/model observation with timestamps,
  usage and transcript evidence; stop on the agreed failure/budget conditions.
  No automatic retries beyond the grant, purchases, broadcasting or publication.
- Depends on F12 and fresh explicit live permission. Commit/evidence: pending.

## Current next step

F00 is closed and published. F01–F13 remain unstarted and need fresh explicit user
authorization: the bootstrap grant never covered application implementation, and
this backlog alone does not grant it.

Start a fresh session from the repository, reconcile this file with mirror
`odd/f1show/tasks`, and authorize F01 before any source edit: validate OpenF1
historical versus live access and auth, endpoint schemas, cadence and quotas; the
Jolpica URL, coverage and identifier mapping; and the current `google-genai` SDK with
the model IDs actually available to this account. Record unknowns instead of
inventing guarantees, and never pin a model ID from a search result.
